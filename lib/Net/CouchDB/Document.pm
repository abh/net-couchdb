=head1 NAME

Net::CouchDB::Document - a single CouchDB document

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::CouchDB;
    # do some stuff to connect to a database
    my $document = $db->insert({ key => 'value' })

    # access the values individually
    print "* $document->{key}\n";

    # or iterate over them
    while ( my ($k, $v) = each %$document ) {
        print "$k --> $v\n";
    }

    # $document is not really a hash, but it acts like one

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Net::CouchDB::Document object represents a single document in the CouchDB
database.  It represent a document which is no longer physically available
from the database but which was once available.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new( $db, $id, $rev )

Generally speaking, users should not call this method directly.  Document
objects should be created by calling appropriate methods on a
L<Net::CouchDB::DB> object such as "insert".

=head2 db

Returns a L<Net::CouchDB::DB> object indicating the database in which
this document is stored.

=head2 delete

Deletes the document from the database.  Throws an exception if there is an
error while deleting.

=head2 id

Returns the document ID for this document.  This is the unique identifier for
this document within the database.

=head2 is_deleted

Returns a true value if this document has been deleted from the database.
Otherwise, it returns false.

=head2 rev

Returns the revision name on which this document is based.  It's possible that
the document has been modified since it was retrieved from the database.  In
such a case, the data in the document may not represent what is currently
stored in the database.

=head2 uri

Returns a L<URI> object representing the URI for this document.

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

These methods are primarily intended for internal use but documented here
for completeness.

=head2 call( $method, $relative_uri [,$content] )

Just like L<Net::CouchDB/call> but C<$relative_uri> is taken relative to
the current document's URI.

=head2 ua

Returns the L<LWP::UserAgent> object used for making HTTP requests.
